# To-Do API with FastAPI and TodoClient

This quick project demonstrates the creation of a very basic local **To-Do API** with **FastAPI** and interacting with it using a custom `TodoClient` class. A simple showcase of working with API's and SDK's.

### What We Did:
1. **FastAPI**: Built a CRUD API for managing to-do items and launched local server. 
2. **TodoClient**: Created a Python client class to interact with the API. Showed how to use the `TodoClient` to create and then called the `create_todo` method to create a new to-do.
